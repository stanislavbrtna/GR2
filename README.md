# GR2
GR2 is simple graphical and graphical user interface library mainly used in SDA_OS. It was designed mainly to be used with 8080 8bit parallel bus LCDs. Hardware driver functions are not part of the library and it is up to the user to implement them.

## Documentation
[Basic draw functions](Docs/lcd_basics.md)
[User interface](Docs/gr2_ui.md)

## Get started
 Simplest way to start with GR2 is to get SDA_OS running with SDL2 base. GR2 is currently not in a state that allows comfortable use of the library without rest of the SDA_OS.
